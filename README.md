### README FILE FOR DOT PRODUCT CODE
In my code i took input as two 2-dimensional vectors ***u*** and ***v***.
The mathematical expression is $u.v=x_1\cdot x_2 + y_1\cdot y_2$ 
Where $x_1,x_2$ and $y_1,y_2$ are coefficients of $i$ and $j$ of vectors ***u***, ***v***.
The python code of the following expression is
```py
x1=int(input("Enter x for u"))
y1=int(input("Enter x for u"))
x2=int(input("Enter x for v"))
y2=int(input("Enter x for v"))
print("Dot product of u,v is ",x1*x2+y1*y2)
```
